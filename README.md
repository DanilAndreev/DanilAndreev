### Overview
Today I am working on __Atlas Render Farm manager__. Render manager - is a software for rendering automation and user control.  

### What is render manager
Imagine that you have 20 computers on which parallel computations must be performed. Now imagine that you have to count 20 different problems in a row on these machines. Each of the tasks on 20 nodes, for example, takes 20 hours to process. It would be nice to automate the distribution of subtasks among nodes and automate the task queue. In addition, I would like to receive statistics on the performance of work. So, these are the problems that the __Atlas__ render manager solves.

### What problems does the Atlas Render Farm manager solves
* Jobs __queue automation__.
* Jobs __distrubution__ between render nodes.
* Collecting __statistics__.
* User __alerting__.
* __Access management__.

### My role
I am team leader and project architect ðŸ˜„.

I am creator of __Material Docs__ - powerful __React__ library for creating documentation in _material design_ style.

### MuiTableFlexible
<img alt="mui-table-flexible logo" height="110" src="https://github.com/DanilAndreev/mui-table-flexible/raw/master/logo256.png"/>  

This __React__ library designed to create __flexible data tables__. Flexible means, that user can change width of each column using special handlers in the table header. Flexible tables help to display big amount of data. 
> But I do not recommend to use tables like that for mobile interfaces ðŸ˜„.  

Repository: [mui-table-flexible](https://github.com/DanilAndreev/mui-table-flexible)
### Routing Manager
__Routing Manager__ - is a __React__ library for __advanced routing__. It helps to simply manipulate with complex routes, do redirects, get route params, etc.  
> This library uses __react-router-dom__.

Documentation: [routing-manager](https://github.com/DanilAndreev/routing-manager)

## ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...
_Programming_: I am improving my __team leader__ skills on my current render manager project. Also, I am trying myself in __project architect__ role.  
_3D_: Now I am learning __Houdini__ for VFX. Also, I am interested in my texturing skills improvement. 


## ðŸ‘¯ Collaboration
Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on some 3D VFX projects. Also, I want to try scripting and plugins creation for 3D software for studios pipelines ðŸ˜„.
