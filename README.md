### MuiTableFlexible
<img alt="mui-table-flexible logo" height="110" src="https://github.com/DanilAndreev/mui-table-flexible/raw/master/logo256.png"/>  

This __React__ library designed to create __flexible data tables__. Flexible means, that user can change width of each column using special handlers in the table header. Flexible tables help to display big amount of data. 
> But I do not recommend to use tables like that for mobile interfaces ðŸ˜„.  

Repository: [mui-table-flexible](https://github.com/DanilAndreev/mui-table-flexible)
