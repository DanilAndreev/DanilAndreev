I am creator of __Material Docs__ - powerful __React__ library for creating documentation in _material design_ style.

### MuiTableFlexible
<img alt="mui-table-flexible logo" height="110" src="https://github.com/DanilAndreev/mui-table-flexible/raw/master/logo256.png"/>  

This __React__ library designed to create __flexible data tables__. Flexible means, that user can change width of each column using special handlers in the table header. Flexible tables help to display big amount of data. 
> But I do not recommend to use tables like that for mobile interfaces ðŸ˜„.  

Repository: [mui-table-flexible](https://github.com/DanilAndreev/mui-table-flexible)
### Routing Manager
__Routing Manager__ - is a __React__ library for __advanced routing__. It helps to simply manipulate with complex routes, do redirects, get route params, etc.  
> This library uses __react-router-dom__.
