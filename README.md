#### What is render manager?
Imagine that you have 20 computers on which parallel computations must be performed. Now imagine that you have to count 20 different problems in a row on these machines. Each of the tasks on 20 nodes, for example, takes 20 hours to process. It would be nice to automate the distribution of subtasks among nodes and automate the task queue. In addition, I would like to receive statistics on the performance of work. So, these are the problems that the __Atlas__ render manager solves.

I am creator of __Material Docs__ - powerful __React__ library for creating documentation in _material design_ style.

### MuiTableFlexible
<img alt="mui-table-flexible logo" height="110" src="https://github.com/DanilAndreev/mui-table-flexible/raw/master/logo256.png"/>  

This __React__ library designed to create __flexible data tables__. Flexible means, that user can change width of each column using special handlers in the table header. Flexible tables help to display big amount of data. 
> But I do not recommend to use tables like that for mobile interfaces ðŸ˜„.  

Repository: [mui-table-flexible](https://github.com/DanilAndreev/mui-table-flexible)
### Routing Manager
__Routing Manager__ - is a __React__ library for __advanced routing__. It helps to simply manipulate with complex routes, do redirects, get route params, etc.  
> This library uses __react-router-dom__.

Documentation: [routing-manager](https://github.com/DanilAndreev/routing-manager)
